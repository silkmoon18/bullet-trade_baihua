"""Persistent request idempotency and a small single-process SQLite outbox.

The outbox is claimed by one embedded dispatcher thread inside the server
process; there are no external workers and no leases. Crash recovery is
handled by :meth:`SQLiteOperationRepository.quarantine_inflight` at startup:
operations that crossed the broker effect boundary (SUBMITTING) become
SUBMIT_UNKNOWN and are never requeued, while outbox rows that were only
CLAIMED return to PENDING so they can be claimed again.
